## Technical Details

The project uses the following main technologies:
- Unobtanium.Web.Proxy for proxy functionality
- Avalonia UI for the cross-platform user interface
- .NET 8.0 framework
- MVVM architecture with CommunityToolkit.Mvvm

### Optimizations

The application has been optimized for minimal file size while maintaining full functionality:
- Full trimming enabled to remove unused code
- Compressed single-file deployment
- Disabled unnecessary .NET features
- Optimized for size with ILLink trimming
- Includes only the essential assemblies needed for operation

### Project Structure

- `ViewModels/`: MVVM pattern view models
- `Views/`: Avalonia UI views
- `src/HkrpgProxy.Core/`: Core proxy functionality
- `Models/`: Data models and configurations

## Troubleshooting

- If the proxy fails to initialize, check if the port is available
- Make sure to run the application with administrator privileges
- Check the connection logs for detailed error messages
- Verify that the game path is correctly set
- If SSL/TLS issues occur, check the certificate handling
- For localhost users: Ensure server files are in the same directory as the launcher
- For localhost users: Start the server before launching the game
